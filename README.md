# Tori
Blender add-ons for creating tori of varying configurations

Some functionality depends on SciPy. The existence of SciPy is checked for at run-time, and if it is not available, this functionality is gracefully disabled.  
For information on how to get SciPy to work in Blender, take a look at [Using 3rd party Python modules](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/5287/using-3rd-party-python-modules) at [Blender Stack Exchange](https://blender.stackexchange.com/).

Browse through the [Tori Wiki](https://github.com/DuaneDibbley/Tori/wiki/Tori) for installation instructions and a usage guide.
