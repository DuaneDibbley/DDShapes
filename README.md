# Tori
Blender add-ons for creating tori of varying configurations

**N.B. Master Branch now depends on SciPy.**  
For information on how to get SciPy to work in Blender, take a look at [Using 3rd party Python modules](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/5287/using-3rd-party-python-modules) at [Blender Stack Exchange](https://blender.stackexchange.com/).  
If you're unable or unwilling to install SciPy, you need to stick with the 0.2 branch.

## Installation
1. Click the **Clone or download** button and save the zip file to your harddrive, but do not unzip it.
2. Open up Blender and hit Ctrl+Alt+U or click _File_ -> _User Preferences_
3. Click _Add-ons_
4. Click _Install Add-on from File..._
5. Select the file you downloaded in step 1 and click _Install Add-on from File..._
6. The name _Add Mesh: Tori_ should appear in the list of add-ons. Click the check box next to it, to enable it.
7. _(Optional):_ To make the change persist, click _Save User Settings_
8. Close the user preferences window.

## Usage

### EllipticTorus
Click _Add_ -> _Mesh_ -> _Elliptic Torus_ or press Shift+A followed by M then click _Elliptic Torus_.  
This creates an elliptic torus with the cross-section correctly following the ellipse. It does so by calculating the normal of the ellipse and rotating the cross-section accordingly.

#### Settings
_Ring's Major Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the major axis of the ellipse.  
_Ring's Minor Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the major axis of the ellipse.  
_Ring Segments_ is the number of segements into which the ring is divided.  
_Ring Spacing_ defines how to calculate the distance between the the cross-sections along the ring.  
_Cross-Section's Major Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the major axis of the cross-section.  
_Cross-Section's Minor Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the minor axis of the cross-section.  
_Cross-Section Segments_ is the number of segements into which the cross-section is divided.  
_Cross-Section Twists_ is the number of half twists to do along the ring, i.e. a setting of 1 produces a Möbius band with an interior.  
_Cross-Section Initial Rotation_ rotates the cross-section on the Y axis **before** aligning it with the ring's normal and moving it to its position. This is the starting rotation, from which the twisting is calculated.  
_Cross-Section Spacing_ defines how to calculate the distance between the vertices of the cross-section.

Setting the major and minor semi-axes to the same value, makes a circle.

Setting the major semi-axis to a smaller value than the minor semi-axis is perfectly fine. While semantically an error, it doesn't pose a mathematical problem; if you do this with the ring, it will be stretched on the Y axis rather than on the X axis, and if you do this on the cross-section, it will be taller than it is wide.

##### Spacing
Equal Area spacing just uses the standard equations for an ellipse, which cause the sectors of the ellipse to have an equal area.  
Equiangular Normal places the vertices of the ellipse such that the angle between the normals to the ellipse is constant.  
Equirectangular Radius places vertices of the ellipse the such that the angle between the radii is constant.  
Equal Arc Length places the vertices of the ellipse at (roughly) equal distance along the limit curve's arc length. This is a bit slow, however, calculating the arc length is non-trivial, though I have optimised it quite a bit.

#### Known issues  
The thickness of the tube isn't exactly constant. This is especially visible if the ring has a high eccentricity and/or low segment count.
