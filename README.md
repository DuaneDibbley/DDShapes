## Usage

### EllipticTorus
Click _Add_ -> _Mesh_ -> _Elliptic Torus_ or press Shift+A followed by M then click _Elliptic Torus_.  
This creates an elliptic torus with the cross-section correctly following the ellipse. It does so by calculating the normal of the ellipse and rotating the cross-section accordingly.

#### Settings
_Ring's Major Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the major axis of the ellipse.  
_Ring's Minor Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the major axis of the ellipse.  
_Ring Segments_ is the number of segements into which the ring is divided.  
_Ring Spacing_ defines how to calculate the distance between the the cross-sections along the ring.  
_Cross-Section's Major Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the major axis of the cross-section.  
_Cross-Section's Minor Semi-Axis_ is half the length of the minor axis of the cross-section.  
_Cross-Section Segments_ is the number of segements into which the cross-section is divided.  
_Cross-Section Twists_ is the number of half twists to do along the ring, i.e. a setting of 1 produces a Möbius band with an interior.  
_Cross-Section Initial Rotation_ rotates the cross-section on the Y axis **before** aligning it with the ring's normal and moving it to its position.  
_Cross-Section Spacing_ defines how to calculate the distance between the vertices of the cross-section.

Setting the major and minor semi-axes to the same value, makes a circle.

Setting the major semi-axis to a smaller value than the minor semi-axis is perfectly fine. While semantically an error, it doesn't pose a mathematical problem; if you do this with the ring, it will be stretched on the Y axis rather than on the X axis, and if you do this on the cross-section, it will be taller that it is wide.

##### Spacing
Equal Area spacing just uses the standard equations for an ellipse, which cause the sectors of the ellipse to have an equal area.  
Equiangular Normal places the circles of the cross-section such that the angle between the normals to the ellipse is constant.  
Equirectangular Radius  places the circles of the cross-section such that the angle between the radii is constant
